# A Global History of Peanut Consumption

## Introduction

In spite of its English name and nutlike taste, the peanut is, in fact, not a nut. This mighty legume is today grown across the world for a variety of uses including human consumption, oil production, and animal feed, as well as playing an important role in crop rotation due to the nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. The taxonomic name of the cultivated peanut, Arachis hypogaea, reflects this tropical plant’s ingenious growth method whereby its flowers bury themselves in the ground to bear fruit, protecting them from cooler night-time temperatures.

While the largest peanut producing nations nowadays include India, China, and the USA, this plant has its origins in South America, having been cultivated by Andean civilisations before spreading further north. [^1] The arrival of the peanut in Europe and its expansion across the globe altered global food production and supply forever, rendering it one of the most ‘successful’ New World plants, along with the potato.

## The Origins of Peanut Cultivation and Consumption

The cultivated peanut is one of many species of the Arachis genus which is thought to have originated east of the Andes mountain range in the area corresponding to modern-day northwestern Argentina, southeastern Bolivia, northern Paraguay, and western Brazil. The exact period of peanut cultivation by humans is unclear but domesticated peanut remains have been dated back more than 7000 years. [^2] The high protein content of the peanut made it an important calorie-dense feature of the Andean diet. In his 1609 history of the Inca, mestizo chronicler Inca Garcilaso de la Vega records peanuts, or ynchic, being eaten toasted and used to make a kind of nougat (‘almond cake’) in combination with honey, but notes that they cause a headache when eaten raw. [^3] He further highlights that peanut oil can be used to cure many illnesses.

As ‘El Inca’ suggests, peanuts were more than just an important food source for Pre-Columbian populations. The Moche civilisation in northern Peru immortalised peanuts in metalwork and on ritual and funerary ceramics, and are believed to have associated them with death, agricultural production and fertility, in part because of the peanut’s subterranean growth process. [^4] A gold and silver peanut necklace was discovered in the Royal Tombs of Sipan in 1980 where the warrior-priest leaders of the Moche were buried, highlighting the peanut’s symbolic and religious importance and also linking their consumption to societal elites. In fact, scholars have suggested that peanuts were a high-status food and symbol on the northern coast of Pre-Columbian Peru, being used in competitive feasts and as a ceremonial offering.

Peanuts were also held in high regard in Mesoamerica, having gradually spread further north via trade networks. In the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, the peanut was known as tlalcacahuatl from the words tlalli (earth) and cacahuatl (cocoa), giving rise to one of the Spanish words for peanut, cacahuate/cacahuete, and suggesting that the Aztec may have been the first humans to combine these two now-ubiquitous flavours. [^5] Although they were less common here than in South America, peanuts were similarly noted for their medicinal properties. In the General History of the Things of New Spain, a comprehensive account of Aztec culture, society and natural history, tlalacacáhuatl is described as a “root” to be given ground up in water to those with a fever, allowing them to expel the ailment in their urine.

## Out of the Americas

Peanuts were encountered by Europeans on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in the early sixteenth century, where they were known by the name maní in the indigeous Taíno language. Today Maní is still the predominant name for peanuts in Latin America, having been adopted into Spanish. Diverging from the appreciation of peanuts by many Pre-Columbian societies, Spanish chronicler Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo linked their consumption on the island to people of low social standing who were not true Christians. [^7] The Spanish located them here as well as in the continental Americas, which led to confusion about the plant’s origins until peanut remains were located in a Pre-colombian tomb in Peru during the nineteenth century. [^8] While the arrival of the peanut in Europe was relatively slow, Spanish Galleons transported peanuts westward from the Americas to China, the Philippines, and the Pacific Islands in the late sixteenth century. Simultaneously, peanuts were being transported across the world by the Portuguese, who had encountered the legume in Brazil around 1500. The peanut was transported from Brazil to the Portuguese enclaves on the West Coast of Africa, where it spread across the continent. From here, it was transported to Portuguese India, where it was termed the ‘Mozambique bean’.

## Mass Consumption: Peanuts as American Staple
       

 Although peanuts originated in South America, their journey north was circuitous—in fact, peanuts were introduced to the United States through Africa, crossing the Atlantic in the hulls of slave ships. This history is embedded in the language of peanuts—the common moniker “goober” entered American English from nguba in Kimbundu, a language spoken in Angola; “pinder,” another term for peanuts in the American South, derives from mpinda in the Kongo language. [^9] Once a high-status foodstuff in the pre-Colombian Americas, in the early 19th century peanuts were often planted in slave communities and otherwise used as feed for livestock. It was around the Civil War that peanuts became more widely popular among southern whites. Southerners turned to peanuts in the face of wartime food shortages, and the crop’s military utility was exploited as peanut oil replaced embargoed Northern whale oil as machinery lubricant. [^10] The popularity of peanuts at the time is commemorated in the southern folk song “Goober Peas.” After the war, spurred on by advances in agricultural technology, the peanut spread throughout the country and at the turn of the century recipes began to appear for the food that would become a ubiquitous American staple—peanut butter.

       
 Instrumental to the rise of the peanut was George Washington Carver, the pioneering Black agricultural scientist, who devoted much of his career to popularizing the crop. Carver, who was born into slavery in Missouri and taught at the Tuskegee Institute during his scientific career, sought to promote crops that could be planted as an alternative to cotton in the American South. Peanuts, as nitrogen-fixing legumes, could enrich nutrient-depleted soils as part of a crop rotation that would boost the yield of future cotton plantings. A 1916 Tuskegee Institute report illustrates Carver’s incredible creativity in devising 105 recipes for peanut-based foods; he also invented a number of other uses for peanuts, including products made from peanut oil. [^11] An influential Black public figure during the age of segregation, Carver promoted peanut production on a local and a national scale—he even testified on behalf of peanut farmers before Congress and helped include protections for domestic peanuts against rising Chinese imports in 1922.

Today, the U. S. is the fourth-largest peanut producer, after China, India, and Nigeria. Yet Americans consume the greatest quantity of peanuts annually of any nation, a phenomenon due at least in part to the widespread popularity of peanut butter, which is a distinctly North American foodstuff—in 2020, 56% of U.S.-grown peanuts were processed into peanut butter. [^13] The American Empire shaped the peanut-related foodways of its colonies as well—peanut butter can be found in the Philippines, a former U.S. colony, and in Europe it is comparatively prevalent in Germany due to the historical and contemporary presence of American troops. [^14]
       

## Multispecies Engagements: Insects, Fungi, Bacteria

Humans are not the only consumers of the peanut plant. Scientific documentation in <!-- Not sure how to Italicize text --> ‘The Peanut, the unpredictable legume; a symposium’ on non-human consumption of the peanut plant reveals insect, fungi, bacterial, and animal ‘consumers’[15]. This consumption is often represented as ‘infestation’ by ‘pests’ and crop damage due to ‘disease’. This language highlights associations of plant damage to economic ‘damage’ of crop yield. Within the discourse centered on peanut cultivation for human consumption, we find the assertive presence of insects that feed on the peanut foliage and its subterranean parts. The insects represented in the following network analysis, for example, are some of the wondrous creatures that share humanity’s appetite for the peanut plant. Some non-human consumers prefer the foliage, or sometimes the juices within the leaves, while others enjoy feasting on the subterranean parts of the plant. Some insects like the Indian Meal Moth, Almond Moth, Saw-toothed Grain Beetle, and Flour Beetles are observed to consume peanuts after they are harvested and when they are stored and transported to markets.

## Conclusion

       The ubiquitous peanut we know today has a rich global history. Having been transported in slave ships, the legume is intricately tied to histories of colonialism and slavery. The peanut has been perceived as both a luxury food in some cultural contexts and as cheap livestock feed in others. It is highly nutritious and protein-packed and hence beneficial to the many life-forms that consume it, including to humans in many different culinary preparations—and yet is also disproportionately represented among fatal allergic reactions to food, a medical phenomenon that continues to puzzle peanut fans and detractors alike.
