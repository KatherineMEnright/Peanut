### A Nut in Name Alone
In spite of its English name and nutlike taste, the <span eid="Q3621199">peanut</span> is, in fact, not a nut. This mighty <span eid="Q145909">legume</span> is today grown across the world for a variety of uses including human consumption, oil production, and animal feed, as well as playing an important role in crop rotation due to the nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. The taxonomic name of the cultivated peanut plant, <span eid="Q37383">*Arachis hypogaea*</span> (hypo- [under], gaea [earth]), reflects this tropical plant’s ingenious growth method whereby its flowers bury themselves in the ground to bear fruit, protecting them from cooler night-time temperatures.

### The Origins of Peanut Cultivation and Consumption
The cultivated peanut is one of many species of the *Arachis* genus which is thought to have originated east of the Andes mountain range in the area corresponding to modern-day northwestern Argentina, southeastern Bolivia, northern Paraguay, and western Brazil.[^2] The exact period of peanut cultivation by <span eid="Q3122657">Andean civilizations</span> is unclear but domesticated peanut remains have been dated back more than 7000 years.[^2] The high protein content of the peanut made it an important calorie-dense feature of the Andean diet. In his 1609 history of the <span eid="Q3404008">Inca civilization</span>, mestizo chronicler Inca Garcilaso de la Vega records peanuts, or <span data-click-image-zoomto="551,753,677,585">*ynchic*</span>, being eaten toasted and used to make a kind of nougat in combination with honey, but notes that they cause a headache when eaten raw.[^3] He further highlights that peanut oil can be extracted and used to cure many illnesses.

As "El Inca" suggests, peanuts were more than just an important food source, they were also a prestigious item with symbolic and religious importance and a connection to societal elites. The <span eid="Q208188">Moche culture</span> in northern Peru immortalised peanuts in metalwork and on ritual and funerary ceramics, and associated them with death, agricultural production and fertility, in part because of the peanut’s subterranean growth process.[^4] They were also used in competitive feasts and as a ceremonial offering. The high status of peanuts is however best immortalised in an elaborate gold and silver necklace that was discovered in the Royal Tombs of Sipan in 1980 where the warrior-priest leaders of the Moche were buried.

Peanuts were also held in high regard in <span eid="Q13703">Mesoamerica</span>, having gradually spread further north via trade networks. In the <span eid="Q12542">Aztec</span> capital of <span eid="Q13695">Tenochtitlan</span>, the location of present day Mexico City, the peanut was known as *tlalcacahuatl* from the words *tlalli* (earth) and *cacahuatl* (cocoa), giving rise to one of the Spanish words for peanut, *cacahuate/cacahuete*, and suggesting that the Aztec may have been the first humans to combine these two now-ubiquitous flavors.[^5] Although they were less common here than in South America, peanuts were similarly noted for their medicinal properties. They are included in Book Eleven, *Earthly Things*, of the twelve-volume *General History of the Things of New Spain*, also known as the <span eid="Q1106019">Florentine Codex</span>, which was compiled by the Spanish Friar <span eid="Q379972">Bernardino de Sahagún</span> in collaboration with his indigenous students during the sixteenth century and gave a comprehensive account of Aztec culture, society and natural history in order to facilitate Spanish evagelization work. Here, *tlalacacahuatl* is described as a “root” to be given ground up in water to those with a fever, allowing them to expel the ailment in their urine. [^6]

### Out of the Americas
Peanuts were encountered by Europeans for the first time on the Caribbean island of <span eid="Q25277">Hispaniola</span> in the early sixteenth century, where they were known by the name *maní* in the indigeous <span eid="Q5232952">Taíno</span> language. *Maní* is still the predominant name for peanuts in Latin America today, having been adopted into Spanish. Diverging from the appreciation of peanuts by many Pre-Columbian societies, Spanish chronicler <span eid="Q919967">Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo</span> linked their consumption on the island to people of low social standing who were not true Christians.[^7] The Spanish located them here as well as in the continental Americas, which led to confusion about the plant’s origins until peanut remains were located in a Pre-colombian tomb in Peru during the nineteenth century.[^8]

While the arrival of the peanut in Europe was relatively slow, <span eid="Q683846">Spanish Galleons</span> transported peanuts westward from the Americas to China, the Philippines, and the Pacific Islands in the late sixteenth century. Simultaneously, peanuts were being transported across the world by the Portuguese, who had encountered the legume in Brazil around 1500. The peanut was transported from Brazil to the Portuguese enclaves on the West Coast of Africa, where it spread across the continent. The peanut was often used as sustenance for enslaved peoples as it could be stored for long periods of time and its hard outer shell helped to protect it from spoilage. From Africa, it was  transported to Portuguese India, where it was initially termed the "Mozambique bean", and also to China.

The first mention of peanuts in a Chinese text dates to 1503, a mere decade after Columbus' "discovery" of the Americas. The manuscript describes boiled or cooked peanuts as "delicious" and gives the origin of its Chinese name 落花生 *luo hua sheng* (commonly now just 花生 *hua sheng*), literally "born from a fallen flower," which is how peanuts were thought to grow.[^9] Peanuts rose in popularity in Chinese cuisine, and came to be depicted in art as well. This agate carving from the <span eid="Q8733">Qing Dynasty</span> shows a pair of peanuts alongside red dates. The carving is a play on words: the characters for red date (枣, *zao*) and peanut (生, *sheng*), are homophones for the first two characters of the auspicious greeting 早生贵子 *zao sheng gui zi*, an encouragement for newly wed couples to soon have children.[^10]

### Mass Consumption: Peanuts as American Staple
       
 Although peanuts originated in South America, their journey north was circuitous—in fact, peanuts were introduced to the United States through Africa, crossing the Atlantic in the hulls of slave ships. This history is embedded in the language of peanuts—the common moniker “goober” entered American English from *nguba* in Kimbundu, a language spoken in Angola; “pinder,” another term for peanuts in the American South, derives from *mpinda* in the Kongo language.[^11] Once a high-status foodstuff in the pre-Colombian Americas, in the early 19th century peanuts were often planted in slave communities and otherwise used as feed for livestock. It was around the Civil War that peanuts became more widely popular among southern whites. Southerners turned to peanuts in the face of wartime food shortages, and the crop’s military utility was exploited as peanut oil replaced embargoed Northern whale oil as machinery lubricant.[^12] The popularity of peanuts at the time is commemorated in the southern folk song “Goober Peas.” After the war, spurred on by advances in agricultural technology, the peanut spread throughout the country.

Instrumental to the rise of the peanut was <span eid="Q296898">George Washington Carver</span>, the pioneering Black agricultural scientist, who devoted much of his career to popularizing the crop. Carver, who was born into slavery in Missouri and taught at the Tuskegee Institute during his scientific career, sought to promote crops that could be planted as an alternative to cotton in the American South. Peanuts, as nitrogen-fixing legumes, could enrich nutrient-depleted soils as part of a crop rotation that would boost the yield of future cotton plantings. A [1916 Tuskegee Institute report](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/209426#page/17/mode/1up) illustrates Carver’s incredible creativity in devising 105 recipes for peanut-based foods; he also invented a number of other uses for peanuts, including products made from peanut oil.[^13] An influential Black public figure during the age of segregation, Carver promoted peanut production on a local and a national scale—he even testified on behalf of peanut farmers before Congress and helped include protections for domestic peanuts against rising Chinese imports in 1922.[^14]

Today, the U. S. is the fourth-largest peanut producer, after China, India, and Nigeria. At the turn of the century recipes began to appear for the food that would become a ubiquitous American staple——peanut butter. Yet Americans consume the greatest quantity of peanuts annually of any nation, a phenomenon due at least in part to the widespread popularity of peanut butter, which is a distinctly North American foodstuff—in 2020, 56% of U.S.-grown peanuts were processed into peanut butter.[^13]

### Peanuts: Politics and Public Space
A characteristic feature in the history and contemporary life of peanuts was/is their presence in public spaces. The vendor selling peanuts, roasted or boiled, shelled or de-shelled, in street-carts or on the roadside, in cones of newspaper or in paper bags, was and continues to be a gloabal practice. The peanut vendor has a certain public visibility that has led to their represenatation in multiple forms of media. The significance of the peanut vendor as the mediator in peanut consumption is brilliantly conveyed by the 1927 song <span eid="Q3050049">*El manisero* [*The Peanut Vendor*]</span> by the Cuban composer and song-writer <span eid="Q661928">Moisés Simons</span>. The composition is sung from the perspective of the seller, and was a hugely influential example of the African and Afro-Cuban influenced <span eid="Q4428744">*son*</span> and <span eid="Q5681688">*pregón*</span> genres that went on to be recorded over 160 times, including in English. In 2005, *El manisero* was added to the [National Recording Registry](https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-06-083/) in recognition of its influence in the history of Latin American music. The lyrics describe the vendor trying to tempt a housewife to buy a cone of peanuts, and include his repeated sales cry of "*maní*, *maní*, *maní*", a typical feature of *pregones*.

The political <span eid="Q89503149">chromolithograph</span> published in 1894 by <span eid="Q1584058">Puck magazine</span> titled *"Puck's presidential impossibility. The political peanut vender"*, uses the image of the peanut vendor in its satirical representation of the U.S politician and former governor of New York, <span eid="Q888410">David B. Hill</span>.[^15] The <span data-click-image-zoomto="255,522,315,291">peanut</span> in the image indicates a [“peanut politics”](https://politicaldictionary.com/words/peanut-politician/) or petty politics motivated by self interest. Besides selling peanuts on the road-side, vendors were often found at other public spaces like circuses, zoos, and fairs. The ubiquitous prescence of peanuts as entertainment food in these spaces led to spectators feeding them to the animals, including elephants, as exemplified by this 1897 theatrical poster featuring a person offering the circus elephant a peanut.[^17] Notably, the peanut is not good for elephants as they require lesser protein and more fiber content in their diet. The text *Marketing Peanuts* (1926) published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture interestingly notes the prohibition of the sale of shelled peanuts in public and amusement spaces in some cities in the U.S to curb the public littering of peanut shells.[^19] While peanut shells were perceived as litter in the context of the public space, the hull and broken peas left over after the industrial de-shelling process was used in the preparation of livestock feed especially during years of low quality crop or poor prices.

### Multispecies Consumption: Insects, Fungi, Bacteria
Humans, animals, and birds are not the only consumers of the peanut plant. In texts on peanut cultivation for human consumption like *The Peanut, the unpredictable legume; a symposium* (1951) published by the National Fertilizer Association in the U.S, we find the assertive presence of insects, fungi, and bacteria that feed on the peanut foliage, subterranean parts, and delicious pods.[^20] Insects like the Indian Meal Moth, <span eid="Q2893450">Almond Moth</span>, Saw-toothed Grain Beetle, and <span eid="Q102347715">Flour Beetles</span> are observed to consume peanuts after their harvest and when they are in storage. The consumption of the peanut plant by the insect is represented within the text as 'infestation' by 'pests' which cause [crop damage](https://www.kew.org/read-and-watch/insect-pests-biggest-threat-plants) directly translating to economic ‘damage’. The insects in the network visualization are but a few of the many wondrous creatures that share humanity’s appetite for the peanut plant. While this network is by no means an exhaustive list of all the insects that feed on the peanut plant, it opens up thinking about the plant as providing nutrients to multiple life forms beyond the human.

       url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KatherineMEnright/Peanut/main/D3%20Ring%20Network%20Peanut.tsv"
       center="Arachis hypogaea">

The text also notes other life forms that consume the peanut which include bacterial and fungal entities which leave their unique markers of consumption: “<span eid="Q4840003">bacterial wilt</span> in the East Indies, <span eid="Q58935125">rosette</span> in Africa, and <span eid="Q6508875">leaf spot</span> in the southern United States”.[^20] The <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="195,105,766,725">roots</span> of the peanut plant as shown in this illustration from *The Encyclopedia of Food* (1923) are the center for multi-species reciprocity with <span eid="Q9164450">nitrogen-fixing bacteria</span> which take from and give back to the soil.[^21] The peanut plant heals and replenishes the soil and is therefore has been cultivated as a global environmental inetrvention method to maintain soil health. Even after harvesting the plant, the peanut shells are sometimes returned to the soil to be used as fertilizer [^22]; to be again 'consumed' by the soil.

As we have seen over the course of this essay, the ubiquitous peanut has a rich global history tied to histories of colonialism and slavery.The peanut has been perceived as as a luxury food in some cultural contexts and as cheap livestock feed in others. It is highly nutritious and protein-packed and hence beneficial to the many life-forms that consume it, including to humans in many different culinary preparations—and yet is also disproportionately represented among fatal <span eid="Q7157933">allergic</span> reactions to food, a medical phenomenon that continues to puzzle peanut fans and detractors alike.
