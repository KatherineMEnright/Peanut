# A Global History of Peanut Consumption

## Introduction

In spite of its English name and nutlike taste, the peanut is, in fact, not a nut. This mighty legume is today grown across the world for a variety of uses including human consumption, oil production, and animal feed, as well as playing an important role in crop rotation due to the nitrogen-fixing bacteria in its root nodules. The taxonomic name of the cultivated peanut, Arachis hypogaea, reflects this tropical plant’s ingenious growth method whereby its flowers bury themselves in the ground to bear fruit, protecting them from cooler night-time temperatures.

While the largest peanut producing nations nowadays include India, China, and the USA, this plant has its origins in South America, having been cultivated by Andean civilisations before spreading further north. [^1] The arrival of the peanut in Europe and its expansion across the globe altered global food production and supply forever, rendering it one of the most ‘successful’ New World plants, along with the potato.

## The Origins of Peanut Cultivation and Consumption

The cultivated peanut is one of many species of the Arachis genus which is thought to have originated east of the Andes mountain range in the area corresponding to modern-day northwestern Argentina, southeastern Bolivia, northern Paraguay, and western Brazil. The exact period of peanut cultivation by humans is unclear but domesticated peanut remains have been dated back more than 7000 years. [^2] The high protein content of the peanut made it an important calorie-dense feature of the Andean diet. In his 1609 history of the Inca, mestizo chronicler Inca Garcilaso de la Vega records peanuts, or ynchic, being eaten toasted and used to make a kind of nougat (‘almond cake’) in combination with honey, but notes that they cause a headache when eaten raw. [^3] He further highlights that peanut oil can be used to cure many illnesses. 

As ‘El Inca’ suggests, peanuts were more than just an important food source for Pre-Columbian populations. The Moche civilisation in northern Peru immortalised peanuts in metalwork and on ritual and funerary ceramics, and are believed to have associated them with death, agricultural production and fertility, in part because of the peanut’s subterranean growth process. [^4] A gold and silver peanut necklace was discovered in the Royal Tombs of Sipan in 1980 where the warrior-priest leaders of the Moche were buried, highlighting the peanut’s symbolic and religious importance and also linking their consumption to societal elites. In fact, scholars have suggested that peanuts were a high-status food and symbol on the northern coast of Pre-Columbian Peru, being used in competitive feasts and as a ceremonial offering.

Peanuts were also held in high regard in Mesoamerica, having gradually spread further north via trade networks. In the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, the peanut was known as tlalcacahuatl from the words tlalli (earth) and cacahuatl (cocoa), giving rise to one of the Spanish words for peanut, cacahuate/cacahuete, and suggesting that the Aztec may have been the first humans to combine these two now-ubiquitous flavours. [^5] Although they were less common here than in South America, peanuts were similarly noted for their medicinal properties. In the General History of the Things of New Spain, a comprehensive account of Aztec culture, society and natural history, tlalacacáhuatl is described as a “root” to be given ground up in water to those with a fever, allowing them to expel the ailment in their urine.

literary treatments. In 2006, the Dutch public selected it as the most beautiful painting in the Netherlands.

## Multispecies Engagements: Insects, Fungi, Bacteria

Humans are not the only consumers of the peanut plant. Scientific documentation in <!-- Not sure how to Italicize text --> ‘The Peanut, the unpredictable legume; a symposium’ on non-human consumption of the peanut plant reveals insect, fungi, bacterial, and animal ‘consumers’[15]. This consumption is often represented as ‘infestation’ by ‘pests’ and crop damage due to ‘disease’. This language highlights associations of plant damage to economic ‘damage’ of crop yield. Within the discourse centered on peanut cultivation for human consumption, we find the assertive presence of insects that feed on the peanut foliage and its subterranean parts. The insects represented in the following network analysis, for example, are some of the wondrous creatures that share humanity’s appetite for the peanut plant. Some non-human consumers prefer the foliage, or sometimes the juices within the leaves, while others enjoy feasting on the subterranean parts of the plant. Some insects like the Indian Meal Moth, Almond Moth, Saw-toothed Grain Beetle, and Flour Beetles are observed to consume peanuts after they are harvested and when they are stored and transported to markets.
